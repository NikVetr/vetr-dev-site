#SAMPLEPREP
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	Tissue samples (10 mg) were homogenized in 120 無 of 10/67.4/22.4/0.18 (v/v/v/v)
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	water/acetonitrile/methanol/formic acid containing stable isotope-labeled internal
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	standards (0.18 ng/無 valine-d8, Isotec; 0.18 ng/無 phenylalanine-d8, Cambridge
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	Isotope Laboratories) using a TissueLyserII bead mill (20 Hz, 2 X 2min; QIAGEN).
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	The samples were place in a -80慢 freezer for one hour and then centrifuged
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	for 10 min (9000g, 4慢). 100uL of each supernatent was transferred to a
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	de-activated inserts within an autsampler vial (Waters).

#CHROMATOGRAPHY
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY        	Extracts (10 無) were injected onto a 150 x 2.1 mm Atlantis HILIC column
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY        	(Waters). The column was eluted isocratically at a flow rate of 250 無/min with
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY        	5% mobile phase A (10 mM ammonium formate and 0.1% formic acid in water) for 1
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY        	minute followed by a linear gradient to 40% mobile phase B (acetonitrile with
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY        	0.1% formic acid) over 10 minutes
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_TYPE           	HILIC

MS:ION_MODE                      	POSITIVE
MS:MS_COMMENTS                   	High resolution, accurate mass data were acquired using a system comprised of a
MS:MS_COMMENTS                   	1290 Infinity II LC System (Agilent; Santa Clara, CA) coupled to a Exploris240
MS:MS_COMMENTS                   	hybrid quadrupole orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific;
MS:MS_COMMENTS                   	Waltham, MA). MS analyses were carried out using electrospray ionization in the
MS:MS_COMMENTS                   	positive ion mode using full scan analysis over 70-800 m/z at 120,000 resolution
MS:MS_COMMENTS                   	and 3 Hz data acquisition rate. Other MS settings were: sheath gas 40, sweep gas
MS:MS_COMMENTS                   	1, Aux Gas 8, spray voltage 3.5 kV, Ion transfer tubetemperature 350蚓,
MS:MS_COMMENTS                   	S-lens RF 70, vaporizer temperature 200蚓, microscans 1, normalized gain control 
MS:MS_COMMENTS                   	target 100%, and maximum ion time 100 ms. Raw data were processed using TraceFinder 
MS:MS_COMMENTS                   	software (Thermo Fisher Scientific; Waltham, MA) and Progenesis QI (Nonlinear 
MS:MS_COMMENTS                   	uDynamics; Newcastle pon Tyne, UK). The identities of profiled metabolites were 
MS:MS_COMMENTS                   	confirmed using reference standards.
